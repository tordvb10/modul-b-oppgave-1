ASSIGNMENT 2

Last lecture I showed you how to make variables that can hold values of the 
various data types. Make some variables of the following datatypes: 
String, number, boolean, array
You can choose what the actual content is.
Try to use both the let and const keywords
******************************************************************************/

/****************************************************************************** 
ASSIGNMENT 3

Try out a few of the operators we looked at (+, -, /, *)
as well as a few of the shorthand operators (++, --, +=, -=)
******************************************************************************/

//your code here

/****************************************************************************** 
ASSIGNMENT 4

Write an IF/ELSE conditional statement that checks that userName isn't 
empty(""), that the user age is 18+, and that userIsBlocked is false. 

(HINT: Use the && (logical AND) to check all 3 in one IF statement)

If all of these conditions are true, change the userIsLoggedIn variable to true 
and the goToPage variable to "/home" then console.log a welcome message. 

If any of the conditions for logging in are not met, console.log an error 
message.

Try changing the values of the variables to make sure your IF/ELSE conditional
can handle all cases correctly 
******************************************************************************/

let userName = "";
let userAge = 18;
let userIsLoggedIn = false;
let userIsBlocked = false;
let goToPage = "";

//your code here

/******************************************************************************
ASSIGNMENT 5

Make a variable called userTitle and set the content equal to "Mr." if userMale 
is true, or to "Mrs." if userMale is false. Use the TERNARY conditional to do 
this:

const variable = statement ? "this if true" : "this if not true"

Try changing userMale to both true and false and console.log your new variable,
to see that your conditional is working.
******************************************************************************/

const userMale = false;
